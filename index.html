                        <h1>Reading Group on AdS/CFT</h1>
                        <h2>Trinity Term 2023</h2>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is a reading group hosted by first-year Particle Theory PhD students focusing on the AdS/CFT correspondence. 
                            The main reference book for the reading group is Horatiu Nastase's "Introduction to AdS-CFT Correspondence" published 
                            by the Cambridge University Press. If you have an SSO account for Oxford you will be able to access the book from
                            <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-the-adscft-correspondence/A66C50256988E64249BB2428631B87D8">
                                Cambridge Core</a> 
                            website. You can also find a set of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.0689.pdf">lecture notes</a> on ArXiV.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We meet every Thursdays at 1400 in the Beecroft Building during term time. Outside term time the meeting time varies. If you wish to join,
                            please email Lucas Leung at lucas.leung@physics.ox.ac.uk .
                        </p>



                        <h2>Preliminary Schedule</h2>
                        <p>This is the preliminary schedule of the reading group. It will be updated as the term evolves. All quoted references are from Nastase.</p>
                        <p>
                            There will be an assigned speaker/ leader per session. The speaker will be responsible for leading the discussion but they need
                            not understand all the material fully. Rather, they might choose to raise up questions to be discussed in the group. The other members
                            are expected to also read the relevant sections of the book and try and understand the material the best they can as well before they turn up
                            to the discussions as well!
                        </p>
